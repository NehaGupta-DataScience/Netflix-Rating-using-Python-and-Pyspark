# Netflix-Rating-using-Python-and-Pyspark
The project revolved around big data and handling such a voluminous amount of data by creating pipelines in pyspark.
The dataset is the part of the popular Netflix price data around which numerous team participated to develop the recommender system.
The dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data.
I have generated the imporant graphs in matplot and seaborn while machine learning models have been created in pySpark.
